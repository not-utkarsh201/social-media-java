# SocialMediaPlatform

A simple Java-based social media platform that interacts with a MySQL database using MyPHP for database management.

## Features
- **User Management**: Users can sign up, log in, and manage their profiles.
- **Post Creation**: Users can create posts, like, comment, and share posts.
- **Comment System**: Users can leave comments on posts.
- **Likes System**: Users can like and view posts they have liked.
  
## Prerequisites
Before you start, make sure you have the following installed:

- **Java JDK**: Version 8 or later.
- **MySQL**: For database storage.
- **phpMyAdmin (MyPHP)**: For managing your MySQL database.
- **Git**: For version control.

## Getting Started

## 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone git@github.com:826aryan/SocialmediaPlatform.git
cd SocialmediaPlatform
```

## 2. Database Setup

1. Create a MySQL database (e.g., `socialmedia_db`).

2. Use phpMyAdmin (MyPHP) or another MySQL client to set up the tables as required by the project.

3. Update the database connection credentials in the `Database.java` file:

   ```java
   public class Database {
       private static final String URL = "jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/socialmedia_db";
       private static final String USER = "your_username";
       private static final String PASS = "your_password";
   }
   ```
   ## 3. Import the Project
Open the project in your favorite Java IDE (e.g., VS Code, IntelliJ, Eclipse).
Make sure the necessary MySQL connector jar (e.g., mysql-connector-j-9.0.0.jar) is added to your project's classpath.

##5. Run the Application
Compile and run the Main.java file, which serves as the entry point.
The application will connect to the MySQL database and launch the social media platform interface.

## 6. MySQL Configuration
Make sure MySQL is running locally and that the database tables are properly set up with the necessary schema for user management, posts, comments, and likes.

## Usage
Login/Signup: Create a new user or log in with an existing account.
Posts: Create and view posts.
Likes: Like and unlike posts.
Comments: Leave comments on posts and view comments.
